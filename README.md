WindowSnapper
=============

WindowSnapper offers convenience window snapping methods which wrap around wmctrl

Setup
============
Open windowSnapper.rb and set PANEL_HEIGHT as well as the header shebang which specifies the location of your Ruby interpreter.

Usage
=============
Pass either right or left into the script as an argument, and it will snap the window to that side and set the vertical width to 100%
